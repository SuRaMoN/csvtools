Compilation
===========
Lale compiles with qmake and qt4 using [qxt](http://dev.libqxt.org/libqxt/wiki/Home) as extra dependecy. Debian based operating systems can install the dependencies by running:

    make get-deps-ubuntu

Provided all the dependecies are installed, compiling is as simple as running:

    make

To build and run the test suite, just type the following in your favorite terminal:

    make run-tests
